Create a new Jupyter notebook for this lesson.

### 1. Exploring the ipyleaflet Documentation

Take a minute to explore the [ipyleaflet documentation](https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

Questions:

  - How is the documentation organized?
  - What can you do with `ipyleaflet`?
  - What is one feature you want to learn more about?

### 2. Feature - Map

Go to the documentation for the [`Map` class](https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/map.html).

Questions:

  - How would you add a layer to the map? (Also, what do you think a layer is?)
  - How would you enable zooming in with the scroll wheel on the map?

### 3. Feature - Basemap

Go to the documentation for the [Basemaps](https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/basemaps.html).

Try changing the basemap of the `Map`! Pick one you want to use for this lesson (one with streetnames would be best).

### 4. Feature - Marker

The `Marker` class lets you draw markers on the map. To draw a marker, you'll need the location of the point you want to draw. Try using Google Maps to find the "Baltimore Aquarium".

In the URL, you'll see the longitude and latitude of the point:
